# Dashy

### What is it used for

Dashy is the service that handles the home page so I can easily access all other services.

I used to use it to also do health checks, but I had way too many problems with that feature


### Volumes

Only volume is config.yml and icons. Nothing to backup

### Env vars

No env vars necessary. All config is in config.yml
