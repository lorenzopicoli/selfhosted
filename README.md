## General info

Most of the magic happens over /ansible.

My current homelab consists of:

- Hardware:
  - Mikrotik router
  - Thrifted switch
  - Unifi AP LR
  - HP Prodesk Mini G4
    - i5-8500T
    - 8GB SODIM DDR4
    - 500GB SSD
  - Raspberry Pi 4 4GB
  - Workstation
    - AMD Ryzen 588X
    - GTX 1060 3GB
    - 64GB DDR4
    - 1 500GB SSD (Linux)
    - 1TB M2 SSD (Windows)
  - Synology NAS
  - Beelink Mini S12 Pro
    - N100
    - 16GB DDR4
    - 500GB M.2

## ISP

- 500mb fiber connection
- Connection is made through PPPoE configured on the mikrotik router.
  - PPPoE requires VLAN tagging of 40

## Virtual Machines

All VMs are run on Proxmox.

All machines have a default firewall policy of accept outgoing and drop incoming.

## Network

#### Divided into VLANs:

- Public VLAN (tag 20)
- Secure VLAN (tag 60)
- Native VLAN (tag 1)
- Work VLAN _Inactive_
- Guest VLAN (tag 30) _Inactive_
- WAN VLAN (tag 40). Used to talk with Ebox

Secure and Native VLANs probably shouldnÂ´t be treated the same, but currently they are exactly the same thing in practice

#### WAN list contains:

- PPPoE-Out1
- vlanWAN (VLAN used for internet connection)
- ether1-WAN

#### Router Firewall

TODO: ADD WIREGUARD CHANGES HERE

- Mikrotik firewall layer protects network primarily
  - Input chain
    - Established, related untracked are accepted
    - Drop invalid
    - Accept ICMP so pings should be allowed on the router
    - Accept local loopback not sure why
    - Secure VLAN is allowed to access the router through the INPUT chain
    - Native VLAN is allowed to access the router through the INPUT chain
    - Drop everything coming from the WAN list. So this should block the router from being accessible over the internet
    - Drop all other inputs
  - Forward chain
    - Allow the public VLAN to access the internet (in public, out pppoe-out1)
    - Allow secure VLAN to access all other VLANs
    - Allow Native VLAN to access all other VLANs
    - Allow ipsec
    - Fastrack established/related
    - Accept established/related
    - Accept DST NAT if out interface is public. So pretty much even if I DST NAT to my secure VLAN by mistake this should only allow the public VLAN to be accessed externally
    - Allow public VLAN to access private VLAN 192.168.40.2 machine on port 53 using TCP and UDP. This is because I want the pi traffic to use Pihole as DNS.
    - Drop invalid
    - Drop from WAN not DSTNATed
    - Drop all other

#### DHCP

Mikrotik serves a DHCP server with 3 different pools for different networks

- Secure VLAN uses 192.168.40.x
- Public VLAN uses 192.168.20.x
- Guest VLAN uses 192.168.30.x _Inactive_

#### Bridge configuration

Router has a bridge configured as follows:

- Dynamic VLAN should have:
  - ID: 1
  - Current tagged: empty
  - Current untagged:
    - bridge-LAN (itself)
    - ether3-Proxmox (webportal uses the native VLAN no specific reason I think)
    - ether5-WLAN the unifi AP uses native VLAN because it does the tagging itself on the wifi SSIDs. So I'm not sure how I could have it not use the native VLAN since it does the tagging itself.
    - ether2-Workstation. Mostly because I've locked the secure VLAN by mistake and it's good to have raw access to the router through this interface
- Public VLAN:
  - ID: 20
  - Current tagged:
    - bridge-LAN
    - ether3-Proxmox: because mongo db for the spotify runs on proxmox. So proxmox tags one machine to VLAN 20
    - ether5-WLAN: I was thinking of making guests use the public network. Not sure if a good or bad idea
  - Current Untagged:
    - ether4-PI so everything that comes out of ether4 is tagged as public. That's where the pi is connected
- Secure VLAN:
  - ID: 60
  - Current tagged:
    - Bridge-LAN
    - ether3-Proxmox: Proxmox uses private network primarily, but it does the tagging itself
    - ether5-WLAN: Unifi provides an SSID for secure network. It does the tagging itself
    - Ether2-workstation: tagged because the beelink also connects here with a switch
  - Current untagged: empty
- Work/Guest VLAN _inactive_:
  - ID: 30
  - Current tagged:
    - bridge-LAN
    - ether5-WLAN: Does tagging itself
  - Current Untagged: empty
